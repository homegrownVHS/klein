## Project Complete

This is an immersive Three.js art installation that places the viewer inside a massive 3D hyperbolic space. The project features:

- Thousands of colorful, textured cubes arranged in hyperbolic patterns
- Realistic lighting and materials for immersive experience
- Automatic camera animation moving through the hyperbolic interior
- Dynamic color transitions and atmospheric effects
- Artistic interpretation of hyperbolic geometry
- Development server running at http://localhost:3000

The experience creates the sensation of floating through an infinite, colorful geometric universe.
